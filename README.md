# launch-countdown-timer

This project used : HTML , CSS , Javascript , GSAP.
The most interesting about this project is the flip effect of the countdown.
I used gsap for animation . If you are new to gsap , you should spend some time on it. It's really convenience.
And you also need transform: perspective() to make the effect look more realistic.

# you need to be extra careful on layout
You have to place things nicely on each other so that it won't collapse or overflow.
The flip effect you see is a combination of animated elements to work together, so be careful on that.  


You should use relative length to adjust the size of things . And thanks to that , i didn't have to use @media .
